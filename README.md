## Project Overview

The Django YouTube Downloader app allows users to download YouTube videos in various formats, such as MP4 (in different resolutions) and MP3. The backend is designed to be highly scalable with automatic node creation based on load, redundancy for failover, and a focus on high availability to ensure no downtime.

---

## Features

- **Video Downloading**: Download YouTube videos in multiple resolutions.
- **MP3 Conversion**: Convert downloaded videos to MP3 format with different quality options.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes and Docker containers to handle traffic spikes.
- **Redundancy and Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and auto-failover to ensure uninterrupted service.
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Automatic load balancing of requests using cloud-based tools.
- **Cloud-native Deployment**: Deployable on AWS, Google Cloud, or other cloud platforms with scalability features.
- **API-based Communication**: RESTful API to communicate with the frontend for seamless video download handling.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for the backend.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: To build the REST API.
- **Celery**: Asynchronous task processing for video downloading and conversion.
- **Redis**: Caching and task queue management.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storage.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration of containers for scalability.
- **AWS / Google Cloud**: Cloud hosting for high availability and scaling.
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy and load balancing.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and logging.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Django 3.x or 4.x**
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Kubernetes** (for cloud-native deployments)
- **Redis** (for caching and queueing)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database storage)
- **Celery** (for asynchronous tasks)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FlxBot001/Django-YouTube-Downloader.git
   cd Django-YouTube-Downloader
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the Database**
   Set up PostgreSQL (or your preferred database) and update the `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.

5. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Django Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the YouTube Downloader.

## Cloud Deployment

### Scaling and Redundancy

This Django app is designed to scale automatically based on the incoming traffic. We leverage **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes** for orchestration. This setup allows us to automatically create new nodes as the load increases and ensures that in case of node failure, other nodes will take over to keep the service running smoothly.

- **AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)**: Automatically scale the app’s compute resources based on traffic.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: For Kubernetes-based auto-scaling.

### Docker and Kubernetes Setup

1. **Dockerize the Application**
   The application can be dockerized by using the following `Dockerfile`:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   CMD ["gunicorn", "project.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
   ```

2. **Kubernetes Manifest**
   Use the following Kubernetes manifest to deploy the app in a scalable environment:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: youtube-downloader
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: youtube-downloader
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: youtube-downloader
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: django
           image: your-docker-image
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8000
   ```

- **URL**: `/api/download-video/`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Parameters**:  
  - `url` (string): The YouTube video URL to download.
  - `resolution` (string): The desired resolution (e.g., `360p`, `720p`, `1080p`).
- **Response**:  
  - `status`: The status of the download (e.g., `success`, `failed`).
  - `download_url`: The URL to the downloaded video.

### Convert to MP3

- **URL**: `/api/convert-to-mp3/`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Parameters**:  
  - `url` (string): The YouTube video URL to convert.

## Monitoring and Logging

Use **Prometheus** for monitoring application health and performance metrics. Visualize these metrics using **Grafana**.

Additionally, integrate **Sentry** for error reporting and track logs using **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **AWS CloudWatch**.
